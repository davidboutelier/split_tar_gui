How to merge the parts together
The script will create a single folder and move all the files from the parts

Windows
---------------
Place the bat file and the tar archives in the same folder
Open a powershell terminal in the folder (Shift + right click then Open Powershell window here)
Execute the bat file (./merge_parts.bat)

Linux & Mac OS (and WSL on Windows)
---------------
Place the bash file and the tar archives in the same folder
Open a terminal in the folder 
Execute the bat file (./merge_parts.bash)

Tar archive was split using Douglas Muth's Tarsplit - A utility to split tarballs into smaller pieces along file boundaries.
